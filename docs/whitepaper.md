##  Title Page

**Project Name:** EnerLink  
**Tagline:** Decentralized Internet Access for Africa  
**Authors:** Chiwill and Team  
**Date:** July 2025

##  Abstract / Summary

EnerLink is a decentralized connectivity platform that bridges users, internet service providers (ISPs), and blockchain infrastructure. It enables seamless ISP switching via eSIM technology, automated network bots, and onchain smart contracts.

Designed for Africa’s fragmented connectivity landscape, EnerLink eliminates downtime, optimizes bandwidth usage, and transforms how individuals access internet services across regions.

---

##  Problem Statement

Millions of users in Africa today face:

- Poor internet reliability and high data costs  
- Inability to switch networks without physically swapping SIM cards  
- Wasted bandwidth due to unused or fragmented data  
- Lack of transparency in ISP performance and billing  

This limits access to digital services, education, and remote work—especially in rural and semi-urban areas.

---

##  Proposed Solution

EnerLink introduces an intelligent, decentralized system that:

- Integrates eSIMs for dynamic ISP switching  
- Uses data vaults for unused bandwidth storage  
- Deploys bots for network monitoring, auto-switching, and fallback  
- Tracks performance and billing via Solana smart contracts  
- Enables bandwidth liquidity and transparency on-chain  

---

##  Key Features

- **ISP Switching Bots:** Detects weak signals and auto-switches to stronger providers  
- **Data Vault:** Stores unused bandwidth for later use or redistribution  
- **Reversal Bot:** Restores better connections when they become available  
- **Decentralized Payment Layer:** Onchain billing with traceability  
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Real-time network and usage tracking  

---

##  Value Proposition

- Reduces downtime in critical moments  
- Enables cost savings via intelligent bandwidth use  
- Removes the need for physical SIM cards  
- Trustless, transparent billing for users and ISPs  
- Modular architecture built for scale  

---

##  Architecture & Technical Overview

EnerLink integrates:

- **Smart Contracts:** Solana-based programs handle pay-per-use logic, bandwidth tracking, and tokenized usage  
- **Backend:** Built with NestJS, integrated with MTN/Airtel sandbox APIs  
- **Frontend:** React + WalletConnect for users and admin dashboards  
- **Bots:** Monitor signal strength, trigger switches, and fallback scenarios  
- **eSIM Logic:** Based on GSMA RSP protocol with planned LPA module support  

Expansion to Base or Polygon possible via modular adapters.

---

##  Tokenomics

**Coming Soon**  
Our focus is currently on real infrastructure, connectivity rollout, and adoption.  
Token plans will be introduced after validating usage and performance in test environments.

---

##  Use Cases

- Freelancer in Lagos auto-switches to Airtel when MTN fails mid-Zoom call  
- Rural school connects via strongest signal using EnerLink’s Data Vault  
- DAO or NGO monitors network uptime across distributed teams using dashboard analytics
