#  EnerLink Business Model

EnerLink is building the foundational layer for decentralized internet access in Africa — starting with a middleware system that bridges users, ISPs, and blockchain tools.

This document outlines how EnerLink creates, delivers, and captures value.

---

##  Problem Summary

In many regions across Africa, users struggle with:

- Poor ISP coverage and constant signal drop-offs  
- High data costs, wasted bandwidth, and unreliable payments  
- A lack of transparency and zero control over network switching  

EnerLink solves this by offering smart ISP switching, eSIM-based access, and blockchain-based payments — all wrapped in a decentralized, censorship-resistant architecture.

---

##  Core Value Proposition

EnerLink delivers value through:

-  **Seamless Connectivity:** Users stay online via auto-switching logic between ISPs  
-  **Transparent Payments:** Usage-based billing handled by smart contracts on Solana  
-  **Bandwidth Efficiency:** Unused data stored in Data Vaults for reuse or sharing  
-  **Censorship Resistance:** DApp frontend hosted via IPFS and accessed via ENS

---

##  Monetization Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Build & Adoption
- **Free MVP access** for early testers, hackathon users, and NGOs
- Focused on **proving switching logic, smart contracts, and eSIM readiness**

### Phase 2: Volume-based Model (Post-eSIM rollout)
- **Pay-per-KB bandwidth access:** Users pay in crypto to unlock time-based or data-based usage  
- **Partner API model:** NGOs, startups, or hardware companies can pay to integrate EnerLink switching

### Phase 3: DAO Governance + Token Incentives
- Future EnerLink Token ($ELINK) will reward:
  - Community validators for uptime
  - Node operators for maintaining switching relays
  - Users for sharing bandwidth via the Vault system

---

##  Revenue Streams

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Usage Microtransactions | Crypto payments per KB or per session |
| Partner API Access | ISPs, NGOs, or routers can integrate switching logic |
| Data Vault Leasing | Users/DAOs can lend bandwidth to others |
| Premium Analytics | Network performance dashboards for institutional partners |

---

##  Sustainability & Growth

- EnerLink aims to become the **connectivity layer for Web3-native Africa**  
- Growth will be driven by:
  - Mobile-first integrations
  - Public-good DAO incentives
  - Collaborations with eSIM platforms, telecom startups, and DePIN projects

---

##  No Token Premine

We are not launching a token prematurely.  
Focus is currently on:
- Infrastructure rollout  
- Product-market fit  
- Real-world user feedback

Tokenomics will be published separately once Phase 2 is underway.
