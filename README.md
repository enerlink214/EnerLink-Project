#  EnerLink

> Decentralized Smart ISP Switching + Unified Payment Gateway  
> Built on Solana. Designed for Africa. Powered by Web3.

##  Overview

EnerLink is a decentralized, smart-switching internet service layer that automatically connects users to the best-performing ISP (MTN or Airtel) based on real-time signal strength — without SIM swaps.

With one blockchain-based payment, users unlock seamless access to multiple ISPs through an intelligent, censorship-resistant platform hosted on IPFS and accessed via ENS.

##  Problem and Opportunity 

In many African markets users juggle through multiple SIM cards and unreliable data plans just to stay online. This results in:
- Manual SIM switching 
- Poor user experience during signal outage 
- Wasted data and increased costs 

Over 50% of users in target regions lacks access to seamless, failover-ready connectivity.

##  Solution overview: EnerLink 

EnerLink is a decentralized smart ISP switching protocol that: 
- Automatically connects users to the strongest local network (e.g.,MTN vs. AIRTEL)
- Enables tokenized, pay-per-KB billing via Solana smart contracts
- Hosts the frontend on IPFS and resolves with ENF for censorship resistance.

##  Getting Started

Coming soon: detailed setup instructions for local dev, testnet interaction, and switching simulation.

To test EnerLink locally:

 1. Clone the frontend
git clone https://github.com/your-org/frontend-repo.git
cd frontend-repo

 2. Install dependencies
npm install

 3. Run locally
npm run dev

Contract deployment and backend setup instructions will be added once Solana testnet deployment is live.
