#  EnerLink

> Decentralized Smart ISP Switching + Unified Payment Gateway  
> Built on Solana. Designed for Africa. Powered by Web3.

---

##  Overview

EnerLink is a decentralized, smart-switching internet service layer that automatically connects users to the best-performing ISP (MTN or Airtel) based on real-time signal strength — without SIM swaps.

With one blockchain-based payment, users unlock seamless access to multiple ISPs through an intelligent, censorship-resistant platform hosted on IPFS and accessed via ENS.

##  Bounty Track Alignment

-  **Nouns** – ENS + IPFS Frontends  
-  **Protocol Labs** – Decentralized Hosting & Fresh Code  
-  **Wildcard** – Secure, Sovereign Systems

---

##  Key Features

###  Smart ISP Switching Engine  
- Monitors signal strength in real time  
- Automatically switches to stronger ISP (MTN or Airtel)  
- Powered by backend logic + automation bots

###  Unified Blockchain Payment  
- One-time crypto payment covers multiple ISPs  
- Pay-per-KB logic tracked onchain  
- Smart contracts built with Anchor on **Solana**

###  Decentralized UI  
- Hosted on IPFS via Web3.Storage  
- Accessible via ENS: `enerlinklab.eth`  
- No central servers or domains

•  Smart contracts handle pay-per-KB access

• Backend checks ISP metrics and controls switching

• Frontend is censorship-resistant and sovereign

##  Getting Started

Coming soon: detailed setup instructions for local dev, testnet interaction, and switching simulation.

To test EnerLink locally:

 1. Clone the frontend
git clone https://github.com/your-org/frontend-repo.git
cd frontend-repo

 2. Install dependencies
npm install

 3. Run locally
npm run dev

Contract deployment and backend setup instructions will be added once Solana testnet deployment is live.
