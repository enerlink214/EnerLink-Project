EnerLink is a decentralized Internet access platform that enables users to automatically switch between mobile network providers (e.g. MTN and Airtel) based on real-time signal strength, while paying for data usage through a unified blockchain-based billing system.

The project addresses the connectivity gap in Africa, where users often suffer from unstable internet, manual SIM swaps, and high data costs. EnerLink eliminates these issues by introducing a smart backend system that monitors network performance and triggers automated switching without any physical action from the user.

Built using Solana smart contracts (via Anchor), a React + NestJS app stack, and decentralized infrastructure (ENS + IPFS), EnerLink also supports tokenized pay-per-KB billing, real-time usage logging, and full frontend decentralization.

This makes EnerLink one of the first modular middleware solutions bridging users, ISPs, and Web3 â€” built to promote sovereignty, transparency, and accessibility in underserved regions.
