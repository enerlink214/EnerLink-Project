This file outlines how EnerLink aligns with different hackathon bounty tracks and their goals.

---

##  Protocol Labs – Fresh Code

- EnerLink is built entirely from scratch within the hackathon window.  
- Uses IPFS (via Web3.Storage) to host frontend — fully decentralized.  
- Clean GitHub commit history available for review.

---

##  Solana Track

- Core smart contracts are written in Anchor and deployed on Solana Devnet.

##  Wildcard – Sovereign Systems

- Promotes digital autonomy in emerging markets.  
- Users can switch ISPs and manage connectivity without centralized gatekeepers.  
- Combines open networks (blockchain) with modular telecom logic.

## ✅ Summary

EnerLink is a strong multi-track submission, built for impact:

- Infrastructure-level use case  
- Blockchain-native payment logic  
- DePIN + connectivity innovation  
- Clean modular architecture
